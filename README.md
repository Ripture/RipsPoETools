A simple weapon dps parser using AutoHotKey.

Use: Run the script and copy items.  The script sees if it's a weapon (item at all, really) and parses the damage values.

The GUI window defaults to minimizing to the system tray.  You can toggle this off via the context menu on the system tray icon.
The window automatically restores upon detecting a new item in the clipboard.
