A simple toolkit using AutoHotKey.

Current Functionality:
 - Parse item data in the clipboard to give an itemized and overall dps value.
 - Track exp/hour given an initial value using a timer.
 
 
Using The Weapon DPS Parser:
 - Copy items in-game (Ctrl-C) and the script will parse the data and give you an itemized and overall dps value.
 - If the GUI is minimized to the system tray or task bar, it will restore and focus to the weapon dps tab automatically.
 
Using The Exp/Hour Calculator:
 - Input initial experience and hit Start.  Input final experience and hit stop.
 - The "Next" button will clear all boxes and move the final experience into initial experience box.  This makes setting up next run quick and easy.

The GUI window defaults to minimizing to the system tray.  You can toggle this off via the context menu on the system tray icon.
