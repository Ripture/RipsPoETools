A simple toolkit using AutoHotKey.


Current Functionality:
 - Parse item data in the clipboard to give an itemized and overall dps value.
 - Calculate Exp/Min using initial and final values as well as an internal timer.
 
 
Using The Weapon DPS Parser:
 - Copy items in-game (Ctrl-C) and the script will parse the data and give you an
	itemized and overall dps value within a tooltip displayed at the mouse cursor.
 

Notes:
 - You can adjust the tooltip timeout values from the system tray icon menu.
